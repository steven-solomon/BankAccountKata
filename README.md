# BankAccountKata

This is the bank account kata I paired on at the Craftsmenship Meetup 

http://www.meetup.com/Software-Craftsmanship-New-York/

## Requirements

- Deposit and Withdraw
- Transfer
- Account statement (date, amount, balance)
- Statement printing
- Statement filters (just deposits, widthdrawal, date)

## The Rules
1. One level of indentation per method
2. Don't use the ELSE keyword (prefer polymophism over if else chains)
3. Wrap all primitives and Strings (don't fall subject to primitive obsession)
4. First class collections 
5. One dot per line (Law of Demeter)
6. Don't abbreviate 
7. Keep all entities small (~50 lines)
8. No classes with more than two instance variables (highly cohesive)
9. No getters/setters/properties (objects are not bags of properties)
